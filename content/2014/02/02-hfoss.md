My journey with the FOSS Box has taken me to new places. This time, I'm returning to class, though unlike most classes I've been involved in before.

This class is about HFOSS.

Not just Free and Open Source Software, but *Humanitarian*. Hacking for Good, as my friend and professor puts it.

Much of the coursework involves getting involved with others. Activities such as going out into the community, attending meetups, and creating applications to help teach on the fourth grade NEw York and Massachusetts curriculum. However, another part of the course involves making blog posts and talking about what we do. This will be the first in a series of such posts.
