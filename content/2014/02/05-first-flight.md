As part of the HFOSS course, we're supposed to make a blog post introducing ourselves. Though I feel that I have [already written a decent introduction][introduction], I suppose I should write a less poetic one.

My name is Matt Soucy. Like I mentioned in the past, I'm a CS student with some interesting specialties. As part of [HFOSS], I'll be working on the OLPC with Sugar to create a game to help teach students at the 4th grade New York math curriculum.
