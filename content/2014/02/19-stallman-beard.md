As mentioned when I posted my [first Literature Review][], for the HFOSS course I'm using my "rating system" is based on the [Stallman Beard][]. This began as a joke based on a github-given name "octo-bearded-nemesis", which rapidly became "octo-bearded Stallman" and decorated the wall of the FOSS Box room at a hackathon.
