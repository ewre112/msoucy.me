Title: RocPy 09/2014
Category: code
Tags: advfoss

As part of [Advanced FOSS], I went to [RocPy] with the class to talk about Python. I posted about my experience back in [February], and I found that this month's meetup lived up to the expectations from last time.

Unfortunately, I've had some personal issues going on lately, including an unpleasant number of projects for other classes. For this reason, I was unable to prepare a lightning talk on some of the projects that I've been doing (for instance [restzzz]).

Because of this, I was somewhat preoccupied, but I did get to listen to the infamous [Ryan Brown] talk about the status of [hflossk], which is a project that he and a classmate have worked on and that powers the [Advanced FOSS] website. It was cool to see what the upcoming plans were, and we even talked (briefly) about the [One YAML to Rule Them All] issue that has been a point of contention recently.

There were a couple of lightning talks:
- One by [RossDylan] on how many companies (usually startups) don't properly secure parts of their website, and how that can be used to reverse-engineer the entire git repository.
- One by [Liam] about two things: a tool that automatically creates an issue on GitHub for a repository, telling it to add a license file, and then a [surprise] for our professor that we've been working on for a while (mainly at his expense)

The meetup was decent, because of the talks, but I still felt like I was looking for the wrong thing there - namely, a more interactive challenge. I would rate it 4/8 [Stallman Beards].
