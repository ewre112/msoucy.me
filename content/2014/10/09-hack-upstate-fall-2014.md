Title: Hack Upstate: Fall 2014
Category: code
Tags: advfoss,hackathons,foss

As [mentioned][Hack Upstate Fall 2013] [previously][Hack Upstate Spring 2014], I attend a few hackathons over the course of the year. One of my favorites is always [Hack Upstate], an event run in Syracuse twice a year. The people there are always a lot of fun to be around, it's a relaxed atmosphere in an interesting building, there's plenty of food, and some interesting projects come out of it. I've been to every official Hack Upstate, and quite a few people recognized me from the previous events.

This time, I started work on [hack 1], and made a surprising amount of progress. The current state of the project is [here][prettyweb]. This was one of the first hackathons I've done when I had a clear goal for a solo project and got it in a semi-completed state. I have a few things that I'm looking at adding, but the bulk of the project is done.

I was with a decent RIT crowd, including [everline], which was a fantastic project by three FOSSBoxers that won the Evernote award. They recently put up a [demo][everline demo] which is great, but needs a little bit of cleanup and error fixing.
