I might be a bit of an addict - when I see someone release code, I like to take a peek to see if it's well-organized, usable, etc. So, when I saw a [forum post] about porting [nanomsg] to [D], I wanted to look.

I didn't get very far. Friends sitting next to me can attest to my reaction to the original organization of the code:

- EVERYTHING was being tracked - including object files and executables.
- "Test" code and "Library" code were all in the root folder
- There were build scripts to build each executable

I submitted one [pull request] to (partially) fix the first issue, and after a message on the forums the original author changed the second two. I'm currently working on another pull to switch it to use [dub].
