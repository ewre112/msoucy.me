Title: ROC.py 12/2014
Category: code
Tags: advfoss

This ROC.py was special. Instead of being at the University of Rochester, it was hosted right in the [MAGIC Center] at RIT. This was to give all of the students in the [HFOSS] course a chance to present their projects at the meetup. They also made the wiki publicly editable, to allow students to document their class projects

Some of the projects:

- A game about creating 24 from the given numbers
- A game about drag and drop programming to give a number
- Draw fences around rectangles with specific requirements
- GeoMunchers, with the goal to "munch" specific shapes and avoid dinosaur pirates.

It was interesting to see some of the issues that the students, some of whom had rarely if ever used Python, had managed to encounter.
