Everything is a Remix.

Even the video I'm reviewing, [Everything Is A Remix], is itself a remix of existing papers talking about the history of certain companies and the ability to copy.

- Written and Remixed by Kirby Ferguson around 2012
- Has a brief overview of the history of remixing and copying ideas, information, and music, and covers some of the legal issues involved when someone chooses to copy or remix something today.

The Good:

- Several in-depth examples in a variety of mediums
- Used humor to keep people interested - even a friend who was in my room when I was watching it was watching and amused by it
- Good introduction to the ideas involved

The Bad:

- Does only cover things briefly, so more detail would be useful
- Some of the audio samples were a bit tricky to make out, more easily distinguishable or recognizable ones might be better
- Gives a rather depressing view of the current state of affairs

The Questions

- How can ordinary people be more involved in the legal issues?
- How likely is it that "subconcious copying" will cause problems for people?
- What can be done to reduce the power that sample & patent trolls have over inventors?
