The other piece that we needed to review was the first two chapters of the [FOSS Primer][].

By Fontana et all, the primer is distributed by the [Software Freedom Law Center][SFLC].

The version we read for class was v1.5.2, published on 4 June 2008.

Overall, the chapters we read gave a quick overview of the different types of license,
as well as some of the most commonly-used licenses and the differences between them.

The Good:

- Offers a succinct overview that should be enough to give the most important details
- Provides references for more information
- Explains simply the differences between the common licenses

The Bad:

- Very dense information
- Jumps right into licenses, which can be surprising for the reader
- Doesn't contain much information about non-code licensing

The Questions:

- What benefit does copyright registration provide?
- What problems would copyright registration provide for the FOSS community?
- When would strong copyleft cause problems?
