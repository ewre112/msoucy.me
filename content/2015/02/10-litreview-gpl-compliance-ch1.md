This week we reviewed the [Software Freedom Law Center Guide to GPL Compliance][SFLCGGC], written by Eben Moglen and Mishi Choudhary and published October 31, 2014.

We only read the first chapter, but it gave an overview of the different freedoms that the GPL covers.

The Good:

- Gives a good overview of the freedoms
- Explains how software can become "open source"
- Covers copyright outside of the USA

The Bad:

- Can be very dense reading
- Uses a lot of "legalese"
- Paints a bleak picture

The Questions:

- How does Software as a Service affect DRM restrictions?
- How does dual licensing work?
- How does the idea of freedom of information affect privacy concerns?
