Title: Lit Review: Company Promises
Category: class
Tags: bizlegfoss

One interesting thing that some companies do is create promises concerning software patents.
Among these are [Red Hat][], [IBM][], and [Google][].

The Good:

- Red Hat agrees to refrain from any sort of patent enforcement for open-source projects
- IBM has committed to not enforcing many of their patents for FOSS projects
- Google's definition relies on the [OSI definition][OSI]

The Bad:

- Red Hat only protects based on specific licenses
- IBM's commitment only holds for 500 of their patents, listed in the pledge
- Google has a similar list to IBM's

The Questions:

- If Red Hat is so opposed to software patents, what reasons do it have for having some?
- Why are some of these (US6332219 for instance) patentable in the first place?
- What consitutes "direct financial interest" in Google's Pledge?

I noticed that IBM and Google had many similarities, the difference being mainly the patents involved and that Google has an escape clause
