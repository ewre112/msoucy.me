> Why are you excited to work on this project?

I don't normally do game-related development, and when I do I'm normally the lead developer - which is bad given that I have no game development experience, I'm mainly a organization/backend/architecture person.

There's a definite lack of games that are FOSS-related - plenty of FOSS games, but none that are about open source development and culture
