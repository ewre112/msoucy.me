Title: Lit Review: GPL & Open Source for Business
Category: class
Tags: bizlegfoss,foss

This review was for two documents: [Using GPL'd Software In-House][gpl] and [Open Source Case for Business: Advocacy][osi].

The Good:

- The GPL doesn't govern USING the licensed software, only copying, modifying, and distributing
- Open-source can be hugely beneficial to businesses of all sizes
- Open source can be found everywhere making up vital internet infrastructure

The Bad:

- The [first document][gpl] was too short to really cover
- The [OSI Document][osi] still mentions Netscape...
- ...and "Perl" is behind most "live" content, not PHP, Python...

The Questions:

- What's the legality of distributing GPL-licensed, unmodified, code as part of a proprietary application?
- What can be done to calm companies' fears about using FOSS?
- What kind of reliability test was done? Stats and data?

The Ratings:

- The [GPL guide][gpl] got 8/8 Stallman Beards
- The [OSI guide][osi] got 8/8 Stallman Beards
