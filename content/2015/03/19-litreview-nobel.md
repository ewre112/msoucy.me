This week we read a [report][lit] about Jean Tirole, the 2014 recepient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

The Good:

- Provides background about Tirole and the situation
- Breaks down the problem of independence and collusion
- Tries to make economy better for consumers (prevent collusion)

The Bad:

- Very dense reading for people with little economic experience
- Only one section seems to really be related to FOSS
- Mainly concerned with proprietary competition

The Questions:

- How does can this really be applied to FOSS?

I was having trouble reading this, about a topic I'm not very familiar with, while preparing for exams this week.

The Rating: 4/8 Stallman Beards
