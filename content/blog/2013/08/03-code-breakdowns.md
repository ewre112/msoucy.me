Title: Code Breakdowns

At work, I notice a lot of strange things.
Legacy code, written in "C++" by developers who were only really familiar with C, or places where the developers fought the existing tools (and lost).

Though I can't give the specific details for the original code,
I'm allowed to post what I'm going to call "Code Breakdown"s - little walkthroughs of some made-up code that shows the original issue, and some possible fixes with pros and cons of each.
Most of these will be written in C++, with perhaps a few in Python or D.

These will come out whenever I find something particularly interesting, which is a poor way to promise content but a good way to make sure that the content is of a quality I find acceptable.
