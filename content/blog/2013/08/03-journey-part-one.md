Six years ago, I did a program at MIT where high school students could take courses taught by college students.
I had my share of interesting adventures, and made some terrific friends.

Two years ago, I started college and wasn't able to see many of those friends very often.
We still stayed in touch, but only casually.

Two months ago, I see a post from one of them talking about a concert in my area, for Journey and Night Ranger.
He wanted to know if anyone wanted to go. Of course, I said yes.

Twenty minutes ago, I arrived at the Concord bus station.
My friend, and some new friends, are arriving in 15 minutes, the first time I see him in more than two years.

Here's to friends that stay in touch, to awesome music, and to awesome memories.
This weekend will be fantastic.
