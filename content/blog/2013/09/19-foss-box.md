Title: Thinking Inside the (FOSS) Box
Category: life
---

One of the groups that I'm involved in on campus is the [FOSS Box](http://foss.rit.edu).
We describe ourselves as the "center of gravity for all things free and open source at RIT", which is a pretty apt description.
We're a community of hackers.
Each of us has different skills and interests, but all of us share an interest in open source development.

The Box is made of some rather "interesting" characters, such as:

* The adjunct professor who describes himself as a "hackademic whose field is hackademia".
  He's a real cause-maker who loves using open-source for the betterment of humanity.
* The [RMS](http://stallman.org "Richard Stallman")-clone who went full-on freedom over the summer
* Our "pixel-ninja" who makes amazing artwork for different projects
* The remote DevOps guru who participates from across the country
* Me, the newly-minted "cloud wrangler"
* The professor who is trying to add more Open Source to the curriculum
* A whole swarm of students of hackademia

Most of us have some common interests - such as Python - but overall we have some amazingly diverse people and some even more amazing projects.
We've got people working on everything from [repository visualization][Gourciferous] to [educational games][SkyTime] to [video chat software][Open Video Chat].
I always feel honored to work with this crew - we make mischief, all in the name of freedom.
