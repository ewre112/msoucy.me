- Open Exchange
- Participation

- Meritocracy
- Community

What are the titles of each General Principle?

1. Make it interesting and make sure it happens
2. Scratch an Itch
3. Minimize how many times you have to reinvent the wheel
4. Solve problems through parallel work processes whenever possible
5. Leverage the law of large numbers
6. Document what you do
7. Release early and release often
8. Talk a lot

What are the similarities between Weber's eight principles, and the five pillars?

- Weber's point 3 is similar to the first pillar, both are concerned with sharing knowledge
- Weber's points 4 and 5 are similar to the second pillar and using a community to aid growth
- Weber's point 7 is essentially the same as the third pillar
- Weber's point 2 is similar to the fourth pillar
- Weber's point 8 is about building a community, much like the fifth pillar

What are the differences?

- Weber's points don't really cover "the best idea wins", which is the general premise of the fourth pillar
- The pillars don't really discuss documenting concretely, though one could argue that that's a component of the community.
