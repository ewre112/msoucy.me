## Team Members

- [Derek Gonyeo (dgonyeo)](http://blog.gonyeo.com) - Handling the tool-based verification
- [Dylan Avery (dylanagq)](http://dxa4481.wordpress.com) - Information about the project and its development 
- [Matt Soucy (msoucy)](http://msoucy.me) - Information about the project and its development 

## Project information:

[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is a service manager for Linux. It handles daemonization and parallelization to help ease services.

Its source is located [here](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd), and communication can be done via its [mailing list](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel), or at the [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/systemd).

### The easy parts:

- Git by a Bus (Just running the tool)
- Callaway Coefficient of Fail (Following the formula)
- Describe the software project, its purpose, and goals (copy-paraphrase from a website)

### The hard parts:

- Detecting turnover in the core team (Deeper analysis of past commits)
- Determining raptor/bus tests (Gauging diversity of the development efforts)
- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (May not be documented)

### How will these be overcome?

Based on asking questions in the IRC channel and news groups, a lot of these problems can be reduced
