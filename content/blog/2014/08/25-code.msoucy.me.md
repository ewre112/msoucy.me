Due to a need to store some personal projects, without making them public (for example, classwork), I've set up a [RhodeCode] instance to enable me to better collaborate with others on not-quite-FOSS projects. Currently there is only a small project [my site](http://code.msoucy.me), which I'll be writing about shortly, but this is also useful for working with classmates and sharing private code with others.
