Last week was the week of the Job Fair at RIT. As always, this involved a number of alumni invading classes to talk about the class and their current employer. One in particular visited the Advanced FOSS course, an excellent fellow by the name of [Russ].

Russ is a guy I know from [Computer Science House][CSH], and an excellent man to talk to about low-level C. In class, he talked about how his working on open source projects was a huge part of landing his current job at Google. He talked about some of his projects, such as [g()()()()('al')][goal], and answered some of the class's questions about his career and how FOSS had played a large role in it.
