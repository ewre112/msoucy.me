Back in the summer, I noticed a post about [bash completions] for [dub], the D package manager. This is awesome, and works nicely for bash, but some people [use other shells][FISH problems].

I wanted to give the same awesome benefits to `fish`, so I did what any sensible person would: I opened a [pull request], which was accepted and closed.
I then forgot about it until I noticed [this post][dub release post], which mentioned some of the big features. On its own bullet:

> Added BASH and FISH shell completion scripts.

I made it to the release notes!
