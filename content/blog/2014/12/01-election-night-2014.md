Though it happened a while ago, I didn't have a chance to write about it yet - I helped set up for, and hacked during, the 2014 Election Night Hackathon.

The main idea of the hackathon is that we project live streams of the election data on the walls around us, and people work on whatever they want.
My project was part of my ADVFOSS work, though many people did "civic hacking" themed projects.
There were some hilarious and excellent projects, and a great turnout, so it was definitely a success.
