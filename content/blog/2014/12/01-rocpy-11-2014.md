This month's [roc.py] went significantly better in my opinion than [October's].

One of the biggest things I noticed was that lightning talks were moved to basically the beginning of the meetup. I feel like this was in response to several peoples' feedback from last month, which was great. We had four lightning talks, including my own, each covering different and interesting things.

The main presentation at the end was somewhat interesting, talking about using Python on a BeagleBone, but the lack of a RIT FOSS turnout was a bit discouraging.

Overall, I'd give it 7/10 Stallman Beards.
