Another recent hackathon that occurred was the Home Stretch Hackathon.

This is less of a structured event, and based on the idea of "RIT's finals week is rapidly approaching, so people have work to do".
It allows people to work in the usual, comfortable enviroment, and get work done, while hanging out with friends and eating pizza.
Obviously, it's a lot more relaxed than an "ordinary" hackathon, with no set rules. The only real requirement was "get things done for your classes".
