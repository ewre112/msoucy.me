A few weeks back, Rochester had its first [Mini Maker Faire]. Both groups I'm involved in, [FOSS@MAGIC] and [CSH], had representatives. I myself manned the table for [FOSS@MAGIC], as part of my duties working there. It was an incredible event, with tons of cool people doing awesome things. I got a chance to take pictures with a couple of local FIRST teams, and got to spread free and open source ideals to a ton of people.
