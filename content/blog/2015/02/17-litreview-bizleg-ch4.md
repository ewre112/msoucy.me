The most recent assignment was to read chapter 4 of the [FOSS Primer][foss-primer].

This chapter discusses the concept of patents, and how they affect FOSS.

The Good:

- Explains what is involved in a patent
- Goes into detail about claims and what restrictions a claim may have
- Dedicated to defending yourself against a patent infringement claim

The Bad:

- The entire idea of software patents with FOSS development
- You can get sued for infringing on a patent that "should" be obvious, or that you have never heard of
- Patents vs. their intended purpose

The Questions:

- Why is searching for patents discouraged?
- What open source licenses are "most" compatible with licensing
- Why are so many common software "inventions" patentable?

Rating: 7/8 Stallman Beards
