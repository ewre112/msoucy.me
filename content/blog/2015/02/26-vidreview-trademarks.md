The most recent video we watched was "[Trademarks and Your Free and Open Source Project][video]".

The Good:

- Free use of a properly-licensed logo (fish pedicure)
- Name conflicts don't really happen within different domains (Sugar on a Stick)
- [Sugar][] got a shoutout
- Made the information understandable and accessible

The Bad:

- GitTip's founder's *kids* were even getting it mixed up with GitHub
- Companies hijacking a trademark for malicious purposes (Evergreen)
- Reiterated a lot that we saw

The Questions:

- I was a bit distracted by the FCC live stream...

The Rating: 8/8 Stallman Beards
