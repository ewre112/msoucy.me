I've been away for a while now (close to a month), so I figured that I should write a post explaining why.

In early April, I left for Montreal to go to [PyCon 2015][]. This was a fantastic opportunity, both to learn more about Python (and show off my skills - I think I impressed a few companies), and to demonstrate what the [FOSS@MAGIC][] program (that I'm a captain of) has produced.

Unfortunately, right after returning from PyCon, I started feeling somewhat ill. This got progressively worse, until I was put in the hospital on April 28th, due to what ended up being pneumonia.

This means that I've been fighting pneumonia, and doing catch-up work, and otherwise been away from my classes, for close to a month. I'm rather far behind, though I'd like to express my thanks to certain professors for allowing me to make up things that I would have otherwise missed, or was too sick to work on.

I'm still not at 100%, I have a rather annoying (though harmless) cough, and just walking across campus takes a lot out of me, but I'm getting better and I've finally returned to class. Hopefully I'll be able to make up the rest of my work quickly, since finals are drawing near.
