Title: Magic Set Editor - Development

For my independent study this semester, I've been working on revitalizing a project that I started working on last year:

[Magic Set Editor][MSE post]

I already gave a writeup there, however I had to restart my development due to some issues with the changes that I had made.

Again, my [fork is on GitHub][fork], and I plan on continuing it to show it off and have it usable for others.

I have a few "stretch goals" in mind for the future:

- Store the set icon as SVG, or have a way to import from SVG
- Possibly a Python-based filetype instead of the custom language currently in place
