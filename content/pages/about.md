I'm a 3rd year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

I spend most of my time tinkering with programming languages, but I'm always open to trying new things.

Primarily, I work in C++, D, and Python, and I tend to write more backend code. I do have experience with numerous other languages, though, and pick up languages fairly quickly.

I can be contacted via [email][Email], [LinkedIn][], or [Google+][], and my resume can be found [here][Resume].
