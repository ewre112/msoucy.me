I'm a software engineer, and a graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

I spend most of my time tinkering with programming languages, but I'm always open to trying new things.

Primarily, I work in C++, Java, and Python, and I tend to write more backend code.
I do have experience with numerous other languages, though, and pick up languages fairly quickly.

I can be contacted via any of the contact links above, and my resume can be found [here][Resume].
